# Broken App Issues

## Variables

Updated all variable initiation to ES2016 naming conventions.
Added developers as object to be deconstructed when being passed into the array.

### Naming

Changed variable names to be more descriptive.

## Routing

Changed route name to be more descriptive.

## Errors

Err is not defined.
Added error messages and error first handling

## Function

Added a promise method to handle sending in the array of developers.  Previous implementation would throw an error due to map not being an available function on the that object type.
